## :eyes: Overview 
We propose a simple yet powerful regularization technique, **DropGaussian**, for neural rendering with sparse input views.

By randomly eliminating Gaussians during the training process, DropGaussian gives the opportunity for the remaining Gaussians to be more visible with larger gradients, which make them to meaningfully contribute to the optimization process of 3DGS.
This is fairly desirable to alleviate the overfitting problem occurring in sparse-view conditions.

We provide:

- âœ… **Full implementation** of DropGaussian
- âš¡ **Minimal plug-and-play code snippet** for quick integration

## ðŸš€ Quick Snippet

Here's a minimal example of how to use `DropGaussian` in your training loop:

```python
import torch
# (Assume the rest of the 3DGS pipeline is already set up)
# Create initial compensation factor (1 for each Gaussian)
compensation = torch.ones(opacity.shape[0], dtype=torch.float32, device="cuda")

# Apply DropGaussian with compensation
drop_rate = 0.1
d = torch.nn.Dropout(p=drop_rate)
compensation = d(compensation)

# Apply to opacity
opacity = opacity * compensation[:, None]
```
